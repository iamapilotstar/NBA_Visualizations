In terms of Defensive strategy teams should focus on forcing the opposition into lowpercentage situations which the model identifies extremely well. This can be achieved by pushing the opponents into poor shooting angles as well as avoiding situations the model has predicted as clear misses and focusing on shot volume in good conditions rather than trying to make the perfect shots in difficult situations. These factors will lead the teams to gain utmost success consistently avoiding statistically unfavorable situations and creating multiple scoring opportunities in higher percentages.")
